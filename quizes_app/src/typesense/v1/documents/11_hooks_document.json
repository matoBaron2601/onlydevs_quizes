This chapter covers the basics and practical uses of hooks, including the built-in hooks, custom hooks, and best practices.\n\n#### What Are Hooks?\nHooks are functions from the React library that allow functional components to utilize state, lifecycle methods, refs, and memoization. They simplify the syntax, making the code easier to understand and manage.\n\n#### Why Were Hooks Introduced?\nHooks address the complexity of sharing reusable functionality between components. They replace older patterns, such as higher-order components and render props, which often result in convoluted code structures. Hooks also make code more concise by reducing the boilerplate involved in using classes.\n\n#### Rules of Hooks\n1. Hooks should only be used in function components.\n2. Hooks must be called at the top level of function components, not within statements, loops, or nested functions.\n\n#### Built-in Hooks\nReact provides 10 built-in hooks, with three primary ones being `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`. Additional hooks include `useReducer`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, `useImperativeHandle`, `useLayoutEffect`, and `useDebugValue`.\n\n- **useState**: Manages state in functional components. It initializes a stateful variable and provides a function to update it.\n- **useEffect**: Handles side effects in function components, similar to lifecycle methods in class components. It can perform operations like fetching data post-render and cleaning up on unmount.\n- **useContext**: Provides a way to access global state or context, simplifying the management of shared data across multiple components.\n\n#### Advanced Usage\n- **useReducer**: An alternative to `useState`, useful for complex state logic dependent on previous states.\n- **useCallback**: Memoizes functions to prevent unnecessary re-creations on re-renders.\n- **useMemo**: Caches expensive computations, enhancing performance by avoiding re-computation.\n- **useRef**: Allows direct manipulation of DOM nodes without causing re-renders.\n- **useImperativeHandle**: Customizes the values exposed to parent components through refs.\n- **useLayoutEffect**: Similar to `useEffect`, but runs synchronously before the browser paints the DOM.\n\n#### Custom Hooks\nCustom hooks facilitate encapsulating reusable logic in functions. They follow the convention of starting with \"use\" and can leverage any of the built-in hooks.\n\n#### Finding and Using Custom Hooks\nMany pre-built custom hooks are available online. Libraries include use-http for HTTP requests, react-fetch-hook for managing data fetches, and libraries for forms and local storage management.\n\n#### Summary\nHooks enhance the React development experience by simplifying state management and promoting the reuse of logic. The chapter outlined how to use built-in and custom hooks, addressing the complexities previously associated with class components. Next, readers will learn about managing complex interfaces and routing in React using React Router.",
