This chapter covers essential concepts and practical implementations of the Context API.\n\n#### Key Concepts\n\n1. **Prop Drilling**: This occurs when components pass props down through multiple levels of the component tree. While this can be straightforward for shallow trees, it becomes cumbersome in deeply nested structures.\n\n2. **Context API**: The Context API allows sharing \"global\" data without prop drilling. It consists of creating a Context object that includes Provider and Consumer components. This enables components to subscribe to changes and receive updates seamlessly.\n\n#### Setting Up Context\n\n- **Creating Context**: Use `React.createContext(defaultValue)` to create a context object, where `defaultValue` is the fallback for components that do not have a matching Provider.\n\n- **Creating a Provider**: The Provider component publishes context data to its descendants through a `value` attribute. You can create a Provider component that encapsulates stateful logic, allowing for a clean and reusable structure.\n\n- **Consuming Context**: Components can consume context data via:\n  - **Class Components**: Use `contextType` or the `Context.Consumer` component.\n  - **Function Components**: Utilize the `useContext` hook to retrieve context values directly.\n\n#### Use Cases for Context\n\nContext is beneficial for managing global data such as:\n- Theming (e.g., light/dark mode)\n- User preferences\n- Language settings\n- User authentication\n\n#### When Not to Use Context\n\nWhile powerful, React Context can create dependencies that make components less reusable. Options like composition patterns should be considered for better reusability and to avoid tightly coupling components to the global state.\n\n#### Composition as an Alternative\n\nInstead of Context, composition allows you to manage component data flow explicitly. By passing down props without relying on global state, components can remain flexible and reusable.\n\n#### Example Application: User Preferences\n\nAn example is provided to illustrate how to create a user interface for setting global preferences using Context. Steps include creating a Provider for units of measurement and consuming that context in descendant components.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile React Context is an invaluable tool for managing global data, it should be used judiciously. The chapter emphasizes understanding when Context is necessary and introduces composition as a viable alternative for cleaner and more reusable code structures. In the next chapter, the focus will shift to using React Portals to manage elements outside a React appâ€™s root DOM node.",
